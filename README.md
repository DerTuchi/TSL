# TSLGen
Template SIMD Library Generator
 - As we are database people, we frequently experienced confusion regarding the term Vector (since it is predominately associated with batched processing). To prevent this confusion, we decided to rename our library. The new name is Template SIMD Library (TSL).

<!-- Todo: Move to Readme?? -->
For detailed information on how to Setup and use TSLGen, please refer to the [GettingStarted](doc/GettingStarted.md) page.
